## I. Portfolio Project Customer Personality Analysis
In this project, I used data from Kaggle to analyze the company's ideal customers, helping businesses better understand their customers and enabling them to easily adjust products according to demand.

You can access the dataset I used at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis

The data consists of 29 columns and 2,240 rows. The dataset is divided into 4 main groups, including customer personal information, product spending over the past 2 years, interaction with promotional campaigns, and purchasing behavior by channel.


In this project, I have:
- Cleaned the data, added auxiliary data columns, and calculated necessary metrics
- Created Pivot Tables
- Created a Dashboard


In the Dashboard:

I highlighted key figures at the beginning of the Dashboard section showing the total number of customers purchasing from the company, their average age, average income, and average years of loyalty with the company to date.

Additionally, I created 6 different charts about: Customer age distribution, Average spending of families with or without young children, Percentage of customers who complained about the company within 2 years, Where customers frequently shop, Shopping spending on products across different age groups, and Spending amount by income groups when there are discounts.
For me, these are the most outstanding charts that fully capture the meaning of the dataset collected from customers.

Finally, I added several filters for the entire dashboard regarding Marital Status, Education Level, Number of children in the family, and Different income groups across various segments.
